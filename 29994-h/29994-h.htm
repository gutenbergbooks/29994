<h1>IRRESISTIBLE WEAPON</h1>

<h2>By H. B. Fyfe</h2>

<p class="hd1">Illustrated by ED EMSH</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In the special</span> observation
dome of the colossal command
ship just beyond Pluto, every nervous
clearing of a throat rasped
through the silence. Telescopes
were available but most of the
scientists and high officials preferred
the view on the huge telescreen.</p>

<p>This showed, from a distance of
several million miles, one of the
small moons of the frigid planet, so
insignificant that it had not been
discovered until man had pushed
the boundaries of space exploration
past the asteroids. The satellite was
about to become spectacularly significant,
however, as the first target
of man's newest, most destructive
weapon.</p>

<p>"I need not remind you, gentlemen,"
white-haired Co-ordinator
Evora of Mars had said, "that if
we have actually succeeded in this
race against our former Centaurian
colonies, it may well prevent the
imminent conflict entirely. In a
few moments we shall know whether
our scientists have developed a
truly irresistible weapon."</p>

<p>Of all the officials, soldiers, and
scientists present, Arnold Gibson
was perhaps the least excited. For
one thing, he had labored hard to
make the new horror succeed and
felt reasonably confident that it
would. The project had been given
the attention of every first-class
scientific mind in the Solar System;
for the great fear was that the new
states on the Centaurian planets
might win the race of discovery
and ...</p>

<p><i>And bring a little order into this
old-fashioned, inefficient fumbling
toward progress</i>, Gibson thought
contemptuously. <i>Look at them&mdash;fools
for all their degrees and titles!
They've stumbled on something
with possibilities beyond their confused
powers of application.</i></p>

<p>A gasp rustled through the
chamber, followed by an even more
awed silence than had preceded
the unbelievable, ultra-rapid action
on the telescreen. Gibson permitted
himself a tight smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Now my work really begins</i>, he
reflected.</p>

<p>A few quick steps brought him
to Dr. Haas, director of the project,
just before the less stunned observers
surrounded that gentleman,
babbling questions.</p>

<p>"I'll start collecting the Number
Three string of recorders," he reported.</p>

<p>"All right, Arnold," agreed Haas.
"Tell the others to get their ships
out too. I'll be busy here."</p>

<p><i>Not half as busy as you will be
in about a day</i>, thought Gibson,
heading for the spaceship berths.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He had arranged</span> to be assigned
the recording machines
drifting in space at the greatest distance
from the command ship. The
others would assume that he needed
more time to locate and retrieve
the apparatus&mdash;which would give
him a head start toward Alpha
Centauri.</p>

<p>His ship was not large, but it was
powerful and versatile to cope with
any emergency that may have been
encountered during the dangerous
tests. Gibson watched his instruments
carefully for signs of pursuit
until he had put a few million
miles between himself and the command
ship. Then he eased his craft
into subspace drive and relaxed his
vigilance.</p>

<p>He returned to normal space
many "days" later in the vicinity
of Alpha Centauri. They may
have attempted to follow him for
all he knew, but it hardly mattered
by then. He broadcast the recognition
signal he had been given to
memorize long ago, when he had
volunteered his services to the new
states. Then he headed for the capital
planet, Nessus. Long before
reaching it, he acquired a lowering
escort of warcraft, but he was
permitted to land.</p>

<p>"Well, well, it's young Gibson!"
the Chairman of Nessus greeted
him, after the newcomer had
passed through the exhaustive
screening designed to protect the
elaborate underground headquarters.
"I trust you have news for us,
my boy. Watch outside the door,
Colonel!"</p>

<p>One of the ostentatiously armed
guards stepped outside and closed
the door as Gibson greeted the
obese man sitting across the button-studded
expanse of desk. The scientist
was under no illusion as to the
vagueness of the title "Chairman."
He was facing the absolute power
of the Centaurian planets&mdash;which,
in a few months' time, would be the
same as saying the ruler of all the
human race in both systems. Gibson's
file must have been available
on the Chairman's desk telescreen
within minutes of the reception of
his recognition signal. He felt a
thrill of admiration for the efficiency
of the new states and their
system of government.</p>

<p>He made it his business to report
briefly and accurately, trusting that
the plain facts of his feat would attract
suitable recognition. They did.
Chairman Diamond's sharp blue
eyes glinted out of the fat mask of
his features.</p>

<p>"Well done, my boy!" he grunted,
with a joviality he did not bother
trying to make sound overly sincere.
"So <i>they</i> have it! You must see our
men immediately, and point out
where they have gone wrong. You
may leave it to me to decide <i>who</i>
has gone wrong!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Arnold Gibson</span> shivered involuntarily
before reminding
himself that <i>he</i> had seen the correct
answer proved before his eyes. He
had stood there and watched&mdash;more,
he had worked with them all
his adult life&mdash;and he was the last
whom the muddled fools would
have suspected.</p>

<p>The officer outside the door,
Colonel Korman, was recalled and
given orders to escort Gibson to the
secret state laboratories. He glanced
briefly at the scientist when they
had been let out through the complicated
system of safeguards.</p>

<p>"We have to go to the second
moon," he said expressionlessly.
"Better sleep all you can on the way.
Once you're there, the Chairman
will be impatient for results!"</p>

<p>Gibson was glad, after they had
landed on the satellite, that he had
taken the advice. He was led from
one underground lab to another, to
compare Centaurian developments
with Solarian. Finally, Colonel Korman
appeared to extricate him,
giving curt answers to such researchers
as still had questions.</p>

<p>"Whew! Glad you got me out!"
Gibson thanked him. "They've been
picking my brain for two days
straight!"</p>

<p>"I hope you can stay awake," retorted
Korman with no outward
sign of sympathy. "If you think you
can't, say so now. I'll have them
give you another shot. The Chairman
is calling on the telescreen."</p>

<p>Gibson straightened.</p>

<p><i>Jealous snob!</i> he thought. <i>Typical
military fathead, and he knows I
amount to more than any little
colonel now. I was smart enough to
fool all the so-called brains of the
Solar System.</i></p>

<p>"I'll stay awake," he said
shortly.</p>

<p>Chairman Diamond's shiny features
appeared on the screen soon
after Korman reported his charge
ready.</p>

<p>"Speak freely," he ordered Gibson.
"This beam is so tight and
scrambled that no prying jackass
could even tell that it is communication.
Have you set us straight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Excellency," replied
Gibson. "I merely pointed out
which of several methods the Solarians
got to yield results. Your&mdash;our
scientists were working on all possibilities,
so it would have been
only a matter of time."</p>

<p>"Which you have saved us," said
Chairman Diamond. His ice-blue
eyes glinted again. "I wish I could
have seen the faces of Haas and Co-ordinator
Evora, and the rest. You
fooled them completely!"</p>

<p>Gibson glowed at the rare praise.</p>

<p>"I dislike bragging, Your Excellency,"
he said, "but they <i>are</i> fools.
I might very well have found the
answer without them, once they had
collected the data. My success shows
what intelligence, well-directed
after the manner of the new states
of Centauri, can accomplish against
inefficiency."</p>

<p>The Chairman's expression,
masked by the fat of his face, nevertheless
approached a smile.</p>

<p>"So you would say that you&mdash;one
of <i>our</i> sympathizers&mdash;were actually
the most intelligent worker <i>they</i>
had?"</p>

<p><i>He'll have his little joke</i>, thought
Gibson, <i>and I'll let him put it over.
Then, even that sour colonel will
laugh with us, and the Chairman
will hint about what post I'll get
as a reward. I wouldn't mind being
in charge&mdash;old Haas' opposite
number at this end.</i></p>

<p>"I think I might indeed be permitted
to boast of that much ability,
Your Excellency," he answered,
putting on what he hoped was an
expectant smile. "Although, considering
the Solarians, that is not
saying much."</p>

<p>The little joke did not develop
precisely as anticipated.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," Chairman Diamond
said, maintaining his smile
throughout, "wisdom should never
be confused with intelligence."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Gibson waited</span>, feeling his
own smile stiffen as he wondered
what could be going wrong.
Surely, they could not doubt <i>his</i>
loyalty! A hasty glance at Colonel
Korman revealed no expression on
the military facade affected by that
gentleman.</p>

<p>"For if wisdom <i>were</i> completely
synonymous with intelligence," the
obese Chairman continued, relishing
his exposition, "you would be a
rival to myself, and consequently
would be&mdash;disposed of&mdash;anyway!"</p>

<p>Such a tingle shot up Gibson's
spine that he was sure he must have
jumped.</p>

<p>"<i>Anyway?</i>" he repeated huskily.
His mouth suddenly seemed dry.</p>

<p>Chairman Diamond smiled out
of the telescreen, so broadly that
Gibson was unpleasantly affected
by the sight of his small, gleaming,
white teeth.</p>

<p>"Put it this way," he suggested
suavely. "Your highly trained mind
observed, correlated, and memorized
the most intricate data and
mathematics, meanwhile guiding
your social relations with your
former colleagues so as to remain
unsuspected while stealing their
most cherished secret. Such a feat
demonstrates ability and intelligence."</p>

<p>Gibson tried to lick his lips, and
could not, despite the seeming fairness
of the words. He sensed a pulsing
undercurrent of cruelty and
cynicism.</p>

<p>"On the other hand," the mellow
voice flowed on, "having received
the information, being able to use
it effectively now without you, and
knowing that you betrayed <i>once</i>&mdash;I
shall simply discard you like an
old message blank. <i>That</i> is an act of
wisdom.</p>

<p>"Had you chosen your course
more wisely," he added, "your position
might be stronger."</p>

<p>By the time Arnold Gibson regained
his voice, the Centaurian
autocrat was already giving instructions
to Colonel Korman. The
scientist strove to interrupt, to attract
the ruler's attention even momentarily.</p>

<p>Neither paid him any heed, until
he shouted and tried frenziedly to
shove the soldier from in front of
the telescreen. Korman backhanded
him across the throat without looking
around, with such force that
Gibson staggered back and fell.</p>

<p>He lay, half-choking, grasping
his throat with both hands until he
could breathe. The colonel continued
discussing his extinction without
emotion.</p>

<p>"... so if Your Excellency agrees,
I would prefer taking him back to
Nessus first, for the sake of the
morale factor here. Some of them
are so addled now at having been
caught chasing up wrong alleys
that they can hardly work."</p>

<p>Apparently the Chairman
agreed, for the screen was blank
when the colonel reached down
and hauled Gibson to his feet.</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me carefully!" he
said, emphasizing his order with a
ringing slap across Gibson's face.
"I shall walk behind you with my
blaster drawn. If you make a false
move, I shall not kill you."</p>

<p>Gibson stared at him, holding his
bleeding mouth.</p>

<p>"It will be much worse," Korman
went on woodenly. "Imagine
what it will be like to have both
feet charred to the bone. You
would have to crawl the rest of the
way to the ship; <i>I</i> certainly would
not consider carrying you!"</p>

<p>In a nightmarish daze, Gibson
obeyed the cold directions, and
walked slowly along the underground
corridors of the Centaurian
research laboratories. He prayed
desperately that someone&mdash;anyone&mdash;might
come along. <i>Anybody</i> who
could possibly be used to create a
diversion, or to be pushed into Korman
and his deadly blaster.</p>

<p>The halls remained deserted,
possibly by arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Maybe I'd better wait till we
reach his ship</i>, Gibson thought. <i>I
ought to be able to figure a way before
we reach Nessus. I had the
brains to fool Haas and ...</i></p>

<p>He winced, recalling Chairman
Diamond's theory of the difference
between intelligence and wisdom.</p>

<p><i>The obscene swine!</i> he screamed
silently.</p>

<p>Colonel Korman grunted warningly,
and Gibson took the indicated
turn.</p>

<p>They entered the spaceship from
an underground chamber, and
Gibson learned the reason for his
executioner's assurance when the
latter chained him to one of the
pneumatic acceleration seats. The
chain was fragile in appearance, but
he knew he would not be free to
move until Korman so desired.</p>

<p><i>More of their insane brand of
cleverness!</i> he reflected. <i>That's the
sort of thing they do succeed in
thinking of. They're all crazy! Why
did I ever ...</i></p>

<p>But he shrank from the question
he feared to answer. To drag out
into the open his petty, selfish reasons,
shorn of the tinsel glamor of
so-called "service" and "progress,"
would be too painful.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">After the first</span> series of
accelerations, he roused himself
from his beaten stupor enough to
note that Korman was taking a
strange course for reaching Nessus.
Then, entirely too close to the
planet and its satellites to ensure
accuracy, the colonel put the ship
into subspace drive.</p>

<p>Korman leaned back at the conclusion
of the brief activity on his
control board, and met Gibson's
pop-eyed stare.</p>

<p>"Interesting, the things worth
knowing," he commented. "How to
make a weapon, for instance, or
whether your enemy has it yet."</p>

<p>He almost smiled at his prisoner's
expression.</p>

<p>"Or even better: knowing exactly
how far your enemy has progressed
and how fast he can continue,
whether to stop him immediately
or whether you can remain
a step ahead."</p>

<p>"B-but&mdash;if both sides are irresistible ..."
Gibson stammered.</p>

<p>Korman examined him contemptuously.</p>

<p>"No irresistible weapon exists, or
ever will!" he declared. "Only an
irresistible <i>process</i>&mdash;the transmission
of secrets! You are living proof
that no safeguards can defend
against <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>He savored Gibson's silent discomfort.</p>

<p>"I am sure you know how far
and how fast the Centaurian scientists
will go, Gibson, since I guided
you to every laboratory in that
plant. Your memory may require
some painful jogging when we
reach the Solar System; <i>but remember
you shall</i>!"</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;you were ordered
to ..."</p>

<p>"You didn't think I was a Centaurian,
did you?" sneered Korman.
"After I just explained to you
<i>what</i> is really irresistible?"</p>
